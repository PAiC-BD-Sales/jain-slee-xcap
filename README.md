# Extended JAIN SLEE XCAP

The Extended JAIN SLEE XCAP is cloned from JAIN SLEE [https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.xcap](https://github.com/RestComm/jain-slee.xcap) from which they have added a set of improvements and new.

## Introduction

Open Source Extended Jain slee allows applications to communicate with legacy communications, providing means to execute statements in asynchronous fashion. Statements are executed in the RA runtime resources, freeing the JAIN SLEE Event Router from the burden of having its executors (threads) resources blocked by interactions with Datasources, and results are provided to applications through JAIN SLEE events. The JAIN SLEE application is also completely free from having to manage connection closings.
